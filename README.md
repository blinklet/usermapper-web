# Usermapper-web

This web app re-uses code from my [Usermapper program](https://github.com/blinklet/usermapper) and enables users to run Usermapper on a website, instead of installing and running it locally on their PC. It's like a "usermapper-as-a-service" application, served as a responsive web app that looks good on computer screens, tablets, and mobile phones.

I wrote a long blog post about building this application. It is posted at:

And, if you're interested, I recorded a series of videos about learning Python when I created the original Usermapper command-line program. You can see those videos at: http://www.brianlinkletter.com/a-python-learning-path-for-network-engineers/
